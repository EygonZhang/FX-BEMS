# FX-BEMS©-v2.0: The GUI-based version
# (Fast XFoil-integrated Blade Element Momentum Solver) 

### Intellectual Property Notice
This plug-in code was developed by researchers **Vaishnavi Gowrishankar** at **Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore**, and is the intellectual property of NTU. Licensing and commercialization are managed by **NTUitive Pte Ltd**, a wholly owned subsidiary of NTU responsible for the protection and licensing of the university's intellectual property. It forms part of a Python-based integrated system that utilizes an enhanced twist-blade Blade Element Momentum (BEM) algorithm coupled with XFoil to enable refined aerodynamic modeling of blade forces.

This v2.0 is released under the NTUitive Dual License Agreement and is made available strictly for non-commercial use, such as academic research, education, or personal learning. **Commercial use, redistribution, or derivative development for commercial purposes** is **not** permitted without prior written permission from NTU via NTUitive.
